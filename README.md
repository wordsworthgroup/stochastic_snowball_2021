# stochastic_snowball_2021

A collection of Matlab scripts to reproduce the results of Wordsworth, ApJL, 2021.

Climate.m and Solver.m are class files for climate processes and the stochastic equation solver, respectively.

Each make_Fig_X.m script creates the corresponding figure in the paper. There is an option to reproduce the figure exactly using saved data, or to re-run the stochastic solver to create another realization of the model output.
